# Projects
Herein lies a collection of a wide array of projects that I have done. Enjoy! 

I am constantly working on some piece of technology. As I finish a project whether it be a game, a simulator or just a fun little thing I coded I will push it here to share with you all!

I am always looking for review and feedback, feel free to leave some feedback!
